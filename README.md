# CS50's Birthdays

This is a web application that allows users to keep track of their friends' birthdays. Users can add, edit, and delete birthdays, as well as search for birthdays by name or month.

## Usage

To run this application, you need to have Python 3 and Flask installed on your system. You also need to set the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to `application.py`.

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```
flask run
```

Then, open your browser and go to the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

You will see a homepage with a list of all the birthdays stored in the database. You can use the buttons on the top right corner to add a new birthday, edit an existing one, or delete one.

You can also use the search bar on the top left corner to find birthdays by name or month. For example, if you type "John" and press enter, you will see all the birthdays of people named John. If you type "January" and press enter, you will see all the birthdays in January.

You can click on any birthday to see more details, such as the year of birth and the age.
